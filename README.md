The stats project is in the "project.r" file.

There are 4 functions for the 4 tasks, if you want to produce an answer, follow these steps:

1.) Scroll down to the main function at the bottom.

2.) Type what function you want to run. If you want an answer for task 1, simply type task1(). It should look like this:

```R

  main <- function(){
    task1()

  }
  main()
  
```


      
     
    
3.) Note that task4 function requires you to enter the number of breaks you want in your histogram, so, when calling it specify the number # you want:

task4(#)
